# Stock Predictor using Linear & Polynomial Regression
# API - TwelveData
Stock Prediction Program, which uses Polynomial and Linear Regression. 
Testing File and Results report also included.
I used the Twelve Data API to get real time data. 

The overall prediction rate is 49%. This was definitely expected as Polynomial and Linear regressions are no where near enough
to make an accurate algorithm to predict stocks. There are many more variables to predicting stocks. If I did another
one, I'd use an LSTM model instead as I think that has a higher accuracy in this matter. However, it was certainly interesting making
this and seeing what the outcomes were. Polynomial Regression with a 5% margin surprised me with its outcome, but
of course a 5% margin could be huge in terms of the stock prices and overall shares invested. You can view the outcomes of each one in the csv file
I have in this repository as it includes all the trials.
